On the Products screen, make the "Open details" link carry the product's id and its currently selected tab (both from the PRODUCT constant) to the details screen. The details screen must read those values from the route and render both. It should also handle being opened directly via a deep link where the values are missing, showing sensible fallbacks instead of crashing or rendering blanks. Keep everything passed between the screens serializable — no functions, class instances, or nested objects.

Work in `/app`. Modify the existing files and add any files required to complete the task.
